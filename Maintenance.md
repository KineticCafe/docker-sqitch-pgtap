# kineticcafe/sqitch-pgtap Maintenance

Maintenance of kineticcafe/sqitch-pgtap is fairly easy but has some intricacies.

## Updating Package Versions

Primary package versions are updated through `package-versions.json`. `pg_prove`
and `sqitch` can currently only be updated with releases; `pgtap` can be updated
with download versions or git references.

Note that this file _must_ be condensed as it is passed as a JSON object in
GitHub Actions:

```sh
jq -c < package-versions.json | sponge package-versions.json
```

### Update `pg_prove`

To `pg_prove`, update `pg_prove.version` in `package-versions.json`. That
version of `pg_prove` will be installed during the build of the Docker image.

### Update `pgtap`

To update `pgtap`, update `pgtap.version` and/or `pgtap.hashref` in
`package-versions.json`. If `pgtap.hashref` is set, pgTAP will be updated from
git (from `https://github.com/theory/pgtap`). If omitted or empty, it will be
downloaded from [PGXN][].

The scripts and functions used by pgTAP vary by PostgreSQL version, so the
updated versions must be cached as `pgtap.tar`, which is committed to this repo.
This cache file can be updated with `just get-pgtap` (this requires
[casey/just][]).

### Update `sqitch`

To `sqitch`, update `sqitch.version` in `package-versions.json`. That version of
`sqitch` will be installed during the build of the Docker image.

## Adding or Removing PostgreSQL Versions

PostgreSQL versions require updating in multiple places:

- `scripts/do_pgtap`: update the `version` case statement (lines 36â€“54) to add
  or remove a version pattern match.
- `build/pgtap/Dockerfile`:

  - Add or remove a `FROM` block for the appropriate version of PostgreSQL.
    These blocks are added in reverse order of version and we only specify
    _major_ PostgreSQL versions.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM postgres:<VERSION>-alpine3.<VERSION> AS build-pgtap-psql-<VERSION>

    ARG PGTAP_VERSION

    COPY pgtap-$PGTAP_VERSION /opt/pgtap-$PGTAP_VERSION

    RUN apk add --no-cache --update perl wget postgresql-dev openssl \
          build-base make perl-dev bash \
        && mkdir -p /opt/pgtap/<VERSION> \
        && cd /opt/pgtap-$PGTAP_VERSION \
        && make && make install \
        && mv sql/pgtap.sql sql/uninstall_pgtap.sql /opt/pgtap/<VERSION> \
        && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /tmp/*
    ```

  - Add a `COPY` line to the `package-pgtap` section:

    ```dockerfile
    COPY --from=build-pgtap-psql-<VERSION> /opt/pgtap/<VERSION> /opt/pgtap/<VERSION>
    ```

When a new version PostgreSQL version is updated, the `pgtap.tar` cache must be
updated with `just get-pgtap`.

## Updating Docker Base Images

Docker base images must be kept up to date. These should be updated based on the
latest available Alpine version for each version of PostgreSQL used in
`build/pgtap/Dockerfile`, and the final release should be the latest available
Alpine version.
